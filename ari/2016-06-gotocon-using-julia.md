# Abstract-Short 
{{*If your talk is accepted this will be made public and printed in the program. Should be one paragraph, maximum 400 characters.*}}

Julia is a new scientific computing language with dynamic features that improve the scientific and numerical computing experience. In this session, I'll introduce the listeners to the language basics and delve into how a programmer (or researcher) can leverage the Julia language into their programming toolkit. 
I'll talk about the language features, its uses in the research world and look at the samples

# Abstract-Detailed
{{*Detailed description - public, if talk is accepted.*}}


### Objectives
{{*What will attendees get out of your talk? When they leave the room, what will they know that they didn't know before?*}}

The attendees (programmers and users) will ...
+ get introduced to the Julia programming language,
+ have an overview of different libraries currently available,
+ researchers can try the simple syntax and the libs available,
+ leave the talk with a good understanding of scientific programming in Julia,
+ understand how they can incorporate Julia code within their current codebase,
+ want to use Julia for analysing large distributed datasets. 

My talk will use Jupyter notebooks for the presentation and being released under the Foss/CC licence, these can be downloaded, edited and re-used under the same licence and CR terms by anyone.

# Biography
{{*Anything else you'd like the program committee to know when making their selection: your past speaking experience, open source community experience, etc.*}}

[SVAKSHA](http://svaksha.com/pages/Bio) is a Foss contributor who has spoken at coding camps and technical conferences like [Pycon-CA](http://2012.pycon.ca/talk/29). Her [Bootstrapping your Foss journey with Julia](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/svaksha/ira/blob/master/2015-07-fsmkcamp/00_index.ipynb) talk at FSMK-Camp was very well received and rated as "worth it / [higher standard](http://harikavreddy.blogspot.in/2015/07/i-always-wanted-my-holidays-to-be.html)" by the student attendees. The Jupyter notebooks and slide materials used in her talks and presentations (including conference proposals) have been released under the AGPL/CC licenses in the [IRA](http://svaksha.github.io/ira) repo on github.
