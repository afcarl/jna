    "+ [Julia](http://julialang.org/) is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language.\n",
    "+ Specially created for scientific programming and technical computing needs.\n",
    "+ Easy syntax - as simple as Python!\n",
    "+ Uses the LLVM-based JIT compiler infrastructure.\n",
    "+ Numerical accuracy with an extensive mathematical function library - via Base and external packages. \n",
    "+ The Base library (written in Julia) integrates C & Fortran Foss libraries for linear algebra, random number generation, signal processing, and string processing.\n",
    "+ IJulia - the browser-based graphical notebook interface to Julia from IPython/Jupyter.\n",
    "+ API's to call other [programming language](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/blob/master/API.md#languages) functions easily.\n",
    "+ Julia is a project under the [NumFocus](http://numfocus.org/projects/index.html) foundation.\n",

    "##<center; style=\"color:purple;\">Cool Features</center> \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multiple Dispatch.\n",
    "    + Define functions and overload them for various types\n",
    "    + Argument types can be user-defined.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Not object oriented. \n",
    "    + Methods wont always belong to one particular object and there are no private methods. \n",
    "    + All methods are public by default, so object access needs to be a part of the core application design. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Built-in package manager.\n",
    "    + `METADATA` makes it easy to install packages via the REPL.\n",
    "    + Uses `git` as the installer.\n",
    "    + The package manager will soon be renamed as `CuratedPackages`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Extensive scientific libraries for [Astronomy](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/blob/master/Astronomy.md), [Mathematics](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/blob/master/Mathematics.md), [Statistics](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/blob/master/Statistics.md), [Physics](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/blob/master/Physics.md), [Chemistry](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/blob/master/Chemistry.md), [Biology](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/blob/master/Biology.md), [AI](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/blob/master/AI.md), [Geography](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/blob/master/Earth-Science.md) and lots more at [Julia.jl](https://svaksha.github.io/Julia.jl/)!\n",
    "    + Extensive scientific libraries with many external packages that can be installed using the built-in package manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. API's to call other [programming language](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/blob/master/API.md#languages) functions.\n",
    "    + Easily call Python code, say, for plotting data, etc.. using the PyCall package.\n",
    "    + Call C functions directly: no wrappers or special API is needed. \n",
    "        - Cxx.jl integrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. A dynamic type system: types for documentation, optimization, and dispatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The JIT compiler boosts the performance, approaching that of statically-compiled languages like C\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Metaprogramming facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. A powerful REPL shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Designed for distributed and [parallel computing](http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.3/manual/parallel-computing/).\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Unicode support.\n",
    "    + Not limited to UTF-8.\n",
    "    + Can use math symbols directly as [unicode input](http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.3/manual/unicode-input/)\n",
    "    + Example: allows the greek chars (α, β, γ, ...) to be input. \n",
