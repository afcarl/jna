# Hello World! 

I'm Vid a.k.a "Svaksha", a software programmer and a long-time [FOSS contributor from India](http://svaksha.com/pages/Bio). I'm thrilled to be a part of this training group for the next few weeks.

In my part of the world, the existing mathematics education is quite lacking for a number of reasons that are too deep to get into here. From volunteering in FOSS, I find that I learn better when I'm teaching and helping others because it forces me to think from a learners view-point. I consider my self a life-long autodidact learner (and plan to return to grad school to pursue research), so beyond the specific boundaries of programming language, CS/Math subjects, I'm interested in learning teaching models that will enable me to improve and fill the gaps, if any, in learning and teaching.

Peace!
